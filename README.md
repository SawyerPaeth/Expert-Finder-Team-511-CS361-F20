# ExpertFinder

The ExpertFinder app was designed to connect Oregon State University students with experts in a wide variety of subjects who are willing to provide mentorship and knowledge.  Perhaps there is a student out there trying to learn a new web framework but their progress has stalled. With ExpertFinder they could search for an expert in that particular framework, connect with them through the app and get help furthering their studies in that framework.
